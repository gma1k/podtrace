# Compatibility Matrix

Where podtrace runs, what features depend on what, and which environments
are known not to work. Rules of thumb at the top, details and verification
commands below.

## At a glance

| Requirement      | Minimum                | Recommended       |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Linux kernel     | 5.8 (BPF ring buffer)  | 6.1+              |
| BTF              | Required on the running kernel | `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` present |
| Architecture     | amd64, arm64           | Same              |
| Kubernetes       | 1.28                   | 1.32–1.36         |
| Cgroup driver    | systemd or cgroupfs    | systemd, v2       |
| Container runtime | containerd, CRI-O    | Same              |
| Privileges       | `CAP_BPF` + `CAP_PERFMON` (kernel 5.8+) or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` (older) | Distinct caps, no full privileged |

## Kernel requirements

### Hard requirement: 5.8+

Podtrace uses BPF ring buffers (`BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF`), which were added
in kernel 5.8. There is no perf-buffer fallback today. On older kernels
the agent will fail to load.

Verify:

```bash
uname -r                       # 5.8 or higher
ls /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux     # exists → BTF available
```

### Building without bpftool

When `bpftool` is unavailable at build time there is no kernel BTF to
generate a header from, and the build falls back to the stub
[bpf/vmlinux.h](../bpf/vmlinux.h).

**Every probe still works.** The stub declares the kernel types the probes
walk — `task_struct`, `pid`, `upid`, `nsproxy`, `net`, `ns_common`,
`css_set`, `cgroup`, `kernfs_node`, `dentry`, `qstr`, `path`, `file`,
`renamedata`, `sock`, `sock_common`, `in6_addr`, `msghdr`, `iov_iter`,
`iovec` — under `preserve_access_index`. The layouts written there are
deliberately not the kernel's: clang emits a CO-RE relocation per field
access and libbpf rewrites every offset from the running kernel's own BTF
when the program loads, so only the field *names* have to match.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **The running kernel still needs BTF.** The stub removes the need for
  BTF on the *build host*, not on the target. A kernel without
  `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` cannot relocate, and the collection will not
  load.
- **Enum values are relocated too, not baked in.** `enum iter_type`, which
  selects how a socket payload is addressed, has been reordered across
  releases. It is read with `bpf_core_enum_value()` rather than taken from
  a header, so a binary built against one kernel does not misread payloads
  on another.

### Kernel features that are genuinely conditional

These are not build-time choices; they depend on the kernel the agent runs
on, and each is detected at load or probe time rather than compiled out:

| Feature | Requires |
|---|---|
| `vfs_rename` argument layout | Detected with `bpf_core_type_exists(struct renamedata)`; the signature changed at 6.3 |
| OOM victim `comm` | Detected with `bpf_core_field_exists(tp->__data_loc_comm)` |
| OOM victim cgroup | `bpf_task_from_pid` / `bpf_task_release` kfuncs |
| `bpf_loop` (traceparent scanning) | 5.17+ |

## Architecture support

Five `BPF_GOARCH` values are wired in the [Makefile](../Makefile):

| Arch     | `__TARGET_ARCH_*` | CI tested | Status      |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| amd64    | `x86`             | ✅        | First-class |
| arm64    | `arm64`           | ✅        | First-class |
| ppc64le  | `powerpc`         | ❌        | Best-effort |
| s390x    | `s390`            | ❌        | Best-effort |
| riscv64  | `riscv`           | ❌        | Best-effort |

CI builds amd64 (ubuntu-latest) and arm64 (ubuntu-24.04-arm) on every
push, see [.github/workflows/ebpf-build.yml](../.github/workflows/ebpf-build.yml).
Other architectures may build but have no test coverage; report
breakage and we will look at it.

## Kubernetes versions

The chart [Chart.yaml](../deploy/charts/podtrace/Chart.yaml) declares
`kubeVersion: ">=1.28.0-0"`.

The Go client surfaces (`k8s.io/client-go v0.36.1`,
`sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.24.1`) realistically support
**Kubernetes 1.32–1.36**. Test against 1.36 in chainsaw e2e and
envtest; 1.28–1.31 remain within the chart's `kubeVersion` floor but
are outside the client-go test matrix.

Verify your cluster version with `kubectl version --short`.

## Cgroup support

Both cgroup v1 and v2 are supported. Both `systemd` and `cgroupfs` drivers
work. Cgroup filtering happens in userspace using `/proc/<pid>/cgroup`,
not via a kernel-side cgroup ID, so the chart sets:

- `PODTRACE_CGROUP_BASE` to the host cgroup root
- `PODTRACE_PROC_BASE` to the host `/proc` (so the agent sees host PIDs,
  not its own container's `/proc`)

See [installation.md#environment-variables](installation.md#environment-variables) for
the full env reference.

## Container runtime

Tested with **containerd** and **CRI-O**. Docker shim (legacy) works on
EKS AL2 with `/run/dockershim.sock`. Auto-detection of the CRI socket
covers the common paths (`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`,
`/var/run/containerd/containerd.sock`, `/run/crio/crio.sock`).

## Privileges

The agent DaemonSet requires:

- `CAP_BPF` (load BPF programs, kernel 5.8+)
- `CAP_PERFMON` (read performance/tracing data)
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is **not** required on 5.8+; it is an older fallback
  some hardened kernels demand.
- `hostPID: true`, hostNetwork on the agent only (so probes see host
  PIDs/sockets)
- Read-only host mounts: `/sys`, `/proc`, host cgroup root

The operator Deployment runs unprivileged as user `65532` (distroless
nonroot). Per-session Jobs inherit the agent capability set on the node
they target.

See [deploy/charts/podtrace/templates/](../deploy/charts/podtrace/templates/)
for the exact `securityContext`.

## Distro-specific notes

Five managed/distro-specific guides are maintained separately. Each one
covers BTF availability, cgroup mode, kernel version, container runtime,
and any platform quirks (AppArmor, SELinux, Pod Security Standards, etc).

| Distro                   | Status   | Notes |
|--------------------------|----------|-------|
| [Azure AKS](aks.md)                | ✅ Supported | Ubuntu 22.04 / Azure Linux, BTF on by default since 1.25 |
| [AWS EKS](eks.md)                  | ✅ Supported (on EC2) | AL2, AL2023, Bottlerocket, Ubuntu node groups |
| [AWS EKS Fargate](eks.md#fargate)  | ❌ Not supported | No BPF / kprobe access on Fargate |
| [Google GKE Standard](gke.md)      | ✅ Supported | COS or Ubuntu, kernel 5.8+ |
| [Google GKE Autopilot](gke.md#autopilot) | ❌ Not supported | No BPF kprobe access |
| [GKE Sandbox (gVisor)](gke.md#sandbox) | ❌ Not supported | gVisor exposes a different syscall surface |
| [OpenShift / OKD](openshift.md)    | ⚠️ Partial | RHEL 9 (5.14+) ✅; RHEL 8 (4.18) ❌ — below 5.8 ring-buffer requirement |
| [Talos Linux](talos.md)            | ✅ Supported | v1.3+ kernel 6.1+, cgroupfs driver |

If you are on a distro not listed and ring-buffer + BTF are available,
podtrace will most likely work. We accept new distro guides as PRs to
this directory.

## Verifying your environment

```bash
# 1. Kernel version (need 5.8+)
uname -r

# 2. BTF available?
ls -l /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux

# 3. Required capabilities reachable?
capsh --print | grep -E "cap_bpf|cap_perfmon|cap_sys_admin"

# 4. Cgroup version
stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup        # cgroup2fs → v2; tmpfs → v1

# 5. Container runtime socket
ls /run/containerd/containerd.sock /run/crio/crio.sock 2>/dev/null

# 6. Architecture
uname -m
```

If everything above checks out and podtrace still fails to start, see
the troubleshooting section in
[installation.md#troubleshooting](installation.md#troubleshooting).
