// read the headers grpc-go hands its transport, and by the HTTP/2 decoder,
// which reads the same headers off the wire. Counting both counts every call
// at least twice. The decoder is the better source: it pairs a request with
// its response by connection and stream, and it sees the trailers, whose
// grpc-status is the call's outcome. The uprobes pair by the thread's last
// TCP peer and never see grpc-status. So for a process whose gRPC calls the
// decoder is seeing, the uprobe events are dropped; for one it is not, such
// as a connection capture joined too late to decode, they still count.
