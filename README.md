A simple but powerful eBPF-based troubleshooting tool for Kubernetes applications.

## Overview

`podtrace` attaches eBPF programs to a single Kubernetes pod's container and prints high-level, human-readable events that help diagnose application issues.

## Features

- **Network Connection Monitoring**: Tracks TCP connection latency and errors
- **TCP RTT Analysis**: Detects RTT spikes and retry patterns
- **CPU Usage per Process**: Shows CPU consumption by process
- **File System Monitoring**: Identifies slow disk operations
- **Process Activity Analysis**: Shows which processes are generating events
- **Diagnose Mode**: Collects events for a specified duration and generates a comprehensive summary report

## Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 5.8+ with BTF support
- Go 1.24+
- Kubernetes cluster access

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build eBPF program and Go binary
make build

# Build and set capabilities
make build-setup
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Trace a pod in real-time
./bin/podtrace -n production my-pod

# Run in diagnostic mode
./bin/podtrace -n production my-pod --diagnose 20s
```

### Diagnose Report

The diagnose mode generates a comprehensive report including:

- **Summary Statistics**: Total events, events per second, collection period
- **TCP Statistics**: RTT analysis, spikes detection, send/receive operations
- **Connection Statistics**: Connection latency, failures, error breakdown, top targets
- **CPU Usage by Process**: CPU percentage per process
- **File System Statistics**: Write and fsync operation latency, slow operations
- **Process Activity**: Top active processes by event count
- **Activity Timeline**: Event distribution over time
- **Activity Bursts**: Detection of burst periods
- **Connection Patterns**: Analysis of connection behavior
- **Network I/O Patterns**: Send/receive ratios and throughput analysis

## Running without sudo

After building, set capabilities to run without sudo:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-capabilities.sh
```
