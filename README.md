</p>

A lightweight yet powerful eBPF-driven diagnostic tool for Kubernetes applications. Podtrace delivers full-stack observability from kernel events to application-layer behavior, all activated on demand, with no prior configuration or instrumentation. With a single command, it uncovers insights across the entire lifecycle of a pod, including network flows, TCP/UDP performance, file system activity, memory behavior, latency patterns, system calls, and high-level application events such as HTTP, DNS, and database queries.

## Overview

Podtrace attaches eBPF programs directly to the container, allowing it to observe real behavior as it happens at runtime. It automatically correlates low-level kernel activity with high-level application operations, surfacing clear, human-readable diagnostic events that reveal what the pod is experiencing internally.

Instead of assembling data from multiple systems or modifying application code, Podtrace provides deep operational visibility in one place, enabling you to understand:

- Why a service is slow  
- Where latency originates  
- How network and I/O resources are being used  
- Which operations block or fail  
- How requests flow through the application  
- What happens inside the pod during incidents  

By combining system-level details, application-layer insights, and real-time event correlation, Podtrace acts as a single on-demand observability lens. This makes it uniquely effective for debugging, performance analysis, and production incident response in Kubernetes environments, especially when time, context, or access is limited.


## Documentation

Podtrace documentation is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.

## Three usage patterns

Podtrace ships one binary that runs in three modes. Pick the one that
fits your workflow:

### 1. Standalone CLI binary

Best for ad-hoc, interactive debugging from a workstation or a
privileged debug pod. Install via signed tarball:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/gma1k/podtrace/releases/latest/download/podtrace_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
  | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local/bin podtrace
```

(`/usr/local/bin` needs `sudo`. To install
without sudo, extract to a user-writable directory on `$PATH` instead, e.g.
`mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && tar xz -C ~/.local/bin podtrace`.)

Or via [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/):

```bash
kubectl krew install podtrace
kubectl podtrace -n production my-pod
```

Then:

```bash
# Realtime trace
podtrace -n production my-pod

# Bounded diagnose with a JSON report
podtrace -n production my-pod --diagnose 30s --export json > report.json
```

By default the CLI spawns a privileged pod on the target pod's node and
runs eBPF there — works on Talos, EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift, and any
cluster where your workstation is not the kubelet host. On kind /
minikube / docker-desktop the workstation **is** the kubelet host, so
add `--local` to skip the spawn and load eBPF on the workstation
directly (faster, no privileged pod needed):

```bash
podtrace --local -n production my-pod
```

For other platforms (linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64) and
cosign-verifiable installs, see
[docs/installation.md#install-the-cli](docs/installation.md#install-the-cli).
The CLI architecture (when to use `--local`, RBAC needed for the spawn
path, etc.) is documented in
[docs/cli-architecture.md](docs/cli-architecture.md).
Full CLI reference: [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

### 2. Continuous tracing via the `PodTrace` CR

Best for long-running observability: have the operator watch a
selector cluster-wide and stream events through an agent DaemonSet.

```yaml
apiVersion: podtrace.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExporterConfig
metadata: { name: prod-otlp, namespace: my-app }
spec:
  type: otlp
  otlp: { endpoint: otel-collector.observability:4318, protocol: http, insecure: true }
---
apiVersion: podtrace.io/v1alpha1
kind: PodTrace
metadata: { name: watch-api, namespace: my-app }
spec:
  selector: { matchLabels: { app: api } }
  filters: [dns, net]
  exporterRef: { name: prod-otlp }
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f trace.yaml
kubectl get podtraces.podtrace.io watch-api -n my-app -o yaml
```

Or skip the YAML and let the CLI author the `PodTrace` for you — target a
whole application by label, across every namespace, and it keeps tracing
through pod restarts and rollouts until you delete it:

```bash
# Trace an application everywhere, continuously:
podtrace watch --app api --all-namespaces --exporter prod-otlp

# Or target with any label selector (--label), scoped to one namespace:
podtrace watch --label app=api,tier=web -n my-app --name api-web --exporter prod-otlp

# Render the manifest instead of applying it:
podtrace watch --app api --all-namespaces --print-only
```

The same `--app`/`--label`/`--all-namespaces` targeting also works on the plain
`podtrace` command for **ephemeral** tracing (stream to your terminal, no CR):

```bash
podtrace --app api -n my-app --diagnose 30s --filter dns,net
```

Rule of thumb: `podtrace <targeting>` = look now (terminal);
`podtrace watch <targeting>` = record continuously (exporter).

Full reference: [docs/crd-podtrace.md](docs/crd-podtrace.md).

### 3. Bounded diagnose via the `PodTraceSession` CR

Best for repeatable, GitOps-driven diagnose runs that produce a
shareable report artifact. Equivalent to the CLI's `--diagnose` mode
but operator-managed and multi-tenant.

```yaml
apiVersion: podtrace.io/v1alpha1
kind: PodTraceSession
metadata: { name: diag-api, namespace: my-app }
spec:
  selector: { matchLabels: { app: api } }
  duration: 30s
  filters: [dns, net]
  exporterRef: { name: prod-otlp }
  reportRef:
    configMap: { name: api-diag-report }
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f session.yaml
kubectl get podtracesession diag-api -n my-app -w   # wait for Completed
kubectl get cm api-diag-report -n my-app -o jsonpath='{.data.report\.txt}' | less
```

This path runs the same eBPF stack the CLI uses, but as a per-node
privileged Job. Results land in three parallel channels:

- `status.summary` — aggregated event counts
- `status.jobs[].eventCount` — per-node breakdown
- `reportRef.configMap` (or `.secret`) — full human-readable report

Full reference: [docs/crd-podtracesession.md](docs/crd-podtracesession.md).

### 4. Recurring diagnose via the `PodTraceSchedule` CR

Best for nightly diagnose sweeps and on-call probes where you want the
last N runs ready to inspect on demand. The schedule fires a fresh
`PodTraceSession` on every cron tick, owns each child via owner
references, and prunes history per the configured limits.

```yaml
apiVersion: podtrace.io/v1alpha1
kind: PodTraceSchedule
metadata: { name: nightly-diagnose, namespace: my-app }
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  successfulSessionsHistoryLimit: 7
  sessionTemplate:
    spec:
      selector: { matchLabels: { app: api } }
      duration: 5m
      filters: [dns, net]
      exporterRef: { name: prod-otlp }
```

Manual one-off trigger from the CLI:

```bash
kubectl podtrace schedule trigger nightly-diagnose -n my-app
```

Full reference: [docs/crd-podtraceschedule.md](docs/crd-podtraceschedule.md).

### Install the operator

The fastest path is the **one-shot quickstart manifest** —
operator + CRDs + a sample nginx workload + `PodTraceSession` that reaches `state: Completed` and writes a report to a ConfigMap. Single `kubectl apply`, no Helm, no clone, no
build toolchain:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/gma1k/podtrace/releases/latest/download/quickstart.yaml

# Watch the demo session reach Completed (~45-60s end-to-end)
kubectl get podtracesession demo-trace -n podtrace-demo -w

# Read the report
kubectl get cm nginx-trace-report -n podtrace-demo \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.report\.txt}'

# Tear down the demo (operator + sample workload + CRDs)
kubectl delete ns podtrace-system podtrace-demo
kubectl delete crd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=podtrace
```

On OpenShift or any OLM-managed cluster, podtrace is also available
via the [OperatorHub.io community catalog](https://operatorhub.io/operator/podtrace):

```bash
# OpenShift Console: Operators → OperatorHub → search "podtrace" → Install
# Or apply the Subscription manifest directly:
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata: { name: podtrace, namespace: operators }
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: podtrace
  source: operatorhubio-catalog
  sourceNamespace: olm
EOF
```

For production Helm-managed deployments — custom values, validating
webhook, multi-tenant agent config — install via the published OCI
chart in GHCR:

```bash
helm install podtrace oci://ghcr.io/gma1k/charts/podtrace \
  --namespace podtrace-system --create-namespace
```
